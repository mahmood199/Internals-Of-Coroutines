/**
 *      The cancel function cancels a coroutine
 *      immediately without waiting for it to 
 *      complete, and returns a Boolean indicating
 *      whether the cancellation was successful
 *      or not. It does not wait for the coroutine
 *      to finish and may leave resources and
 *      tasks running in the background. 
 *      This function is typically used when
 *      the coroutine needs to be cancelled immediately.
 *         
 *      On the other hand, the cancelAndJoin
 *      function cancels a coroutine and waits
 *      for it to complete before returning.
 *      It also rethrows any exceptions that were
 *      thrown by the cancelled coroutine during 
 *      its execution. This function is typically 
 *      used when the calling coroutine needs to 
 *      wait for the cancelled coroutine to complete
 *      and handle any exceptions that occurred during its execution.
